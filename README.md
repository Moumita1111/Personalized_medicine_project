# Project Overview
Personalized-Medicine-Redefining-Cancer-Treatment is a problem of classifying the given genetic mutations based on the literature available in the medical domain into one of the given 9 classes.

But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Currently, this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

The machine learning solution to this problem will help to speed up this time-consuming procedure and produce results with significant accuracy.
